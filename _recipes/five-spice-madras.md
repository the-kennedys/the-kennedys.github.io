# Method 

Get the pan really hot, and put just enough oil in the base of the pan to cover the bottom  

Get the oil nice and hot so that when you start cooking you can go right head and start bringing out all the flavours of all the ingredients 

Fry the garlic, add the spices (don’t overcook), add the tomato puree and a spoon of base gravy. 

Add a squirt of lemon juice, the “meat” 

Add 3 spoons of base gravy, cook until oil comes to top 

Add 3 more spoons of base gravy and again cook until the oil comes to the top 

Throw in the coriander 

Add the salt 

Another spoon of base gravy, cook off and serve
